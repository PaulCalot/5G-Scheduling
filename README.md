# 5G Scheduling

This project took place during the course on *Algorithms analysis and conceptions* at Ecole polytechnique, early 2020.

Project defence took place in February 2020. 

## Short descroption of the problem

"In 5G, an antenna transmits data packets to smartphones (or users) through a wireless medium, which is divided into a set of frequency channels. Figure 1 is an example of simultaneous transmission towards three users using three channels. 

The higher the power dedicated to a user, the higher the data rate it can experience. The exact dependence between power and data rate is however user and channel specific. With the same transmit power, a user close to the antenna will enjoy for example a higher data rate than a user far away. A wireless packet scheduler is thus responsible to allocated channels to users and to divide the total power budget of the antenna among the available channels. The goal of this project is to design optimal packet schedulers in this context."

To achieve that, three parts are available : 
* preprocessing to eliminate obvious wrong possibilities ;
* offline processing with several methods used : greedy algorithm, dynamic programming algorithm, branch and bound algorithm ;
* online processing.

Only the first two steps have been adressed here.
